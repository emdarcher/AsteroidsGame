# Asteroids Part 2: An Array of Asteroids


Now that we have a functioning space ship, we'll add some Asteroids to our game. We'll write an Asteroid class that extends Floater.
##Steps to completing this assignment

  - Write an Asteroid class that extends Floater. Make sure it's not inside the curly braces of any other class. You will need to
      * write a constructor
      * write the code to "finish" the abstract methods in the Floater class
      * add a new int member variable to hold the speed of rotation for each asteroid. Make sure that this is initialized to have an equal probablility of being positive or negative. Also make sure to declare appropriately (should it be public or private?)
      * "override" the move method of the Floater class by writing a new move method in the Asteroid class that also rotates each Asteroid at its own speed
   
     Now add just a single asteroid to your applet. Start by just drawing the asteroid. Make sure you can see it and are happy with its shape before going to the next step.
    Now add the code that moves and rotates the Asteroid
    Modify your applet code so that you have an array of Asteroids.

You will need a web page to display your applet. Your homepage should have a link to the web page for this assignment.
Extensions

If you have extra time, you might try to figure out how to check to see if the ship has collided with an asteroid.
